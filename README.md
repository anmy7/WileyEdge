# WileyEdge

This repository contains exercises, projects and pieces of code from the course C306 Scala from Wiley-Edge.
There are three main sections in the repository.

- [Class Exercises](https://github.com/anmy7/WileyEdge/tree/master/src/main/scala/com/training/classActivities)
- [Banking Project](https://github.com/anmy7/WileyEdge/tree/master/src/main/scala/com/training/scalaProject)
- [Slides Exercises](https://github.com/anmy7/WileyEdge/tree/master/src/main/scala/com/training/slideExercises)

Moreover, there is another section which is part of the Class exercises and contains different Unit tests.
- [Tests](https://github.com/anmy7/WileyEdge/tree/master/src/test/scala)

# Banking Project
The banking project has 5 main classes which are:
- [Bank](https://github.com/anmy7/WileyEdge/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/training/scalaProject/Bank.scala)
- [Customer](https://github.com/anmy7/WileyEdge/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/training/scalaProject/Customer.scala)
- [Account](https://github.com/anmy7/WileyEdge/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/training/scalaProject/Account.scala)
- [CreditCard](https://github.com/anmy7/WileyEdge/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/training/scalaProject/CreditCard.scala)
- [Loan](https://github.com/anmy7/WileyEdge/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/training/scalaProject/Loan.scala)

There are also some other classes which are the following:
- [Load Data from Database](https://github.com/anmy7/WileyEdge/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/training/scalaProject/LoadData.scala)
- [Tests of the Banking systems](https://github.com/anmy7/WileyEdge/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/training/scalaProject/Test.scala)
- [Main](https://github.com/anmy7/WileyEdge/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/training/scalaProject/Main.scala)


## Improvements
There are a couple of improvements that can be approached. These are:
- Modifying the balance when transactions are performed.
- Save the digital signature in the database.
- A database table which stores the transactions.
- Send money to International accounts through IBAN and SWIFT.
- Private banking login (mobile phone login)
